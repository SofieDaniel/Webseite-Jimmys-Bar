# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "The Admin CMS implementation is not working correctly. When navigating to /admin, the main site is displayed instead of the admin login page. The admin route is defined correctly in the App.js file, but the login form is not being rendered. This appears to be an issue with the React Router configuration or client-side routing. The backend API endpoints for authentication are accessible and return the expected responses, but the frontend is not properly routing to the admin page."

        comment: "Conducted detailed testing of the admin route functionality. The issue is confirmed to be a client-side routing problem. When accessing /admin directly, the server returns the base HTML without the admin component being rendered. The backend authentication APIs are working correctly (successful login with admin/jimmy2024 credentials and JWT token validation). The admin-specific API endpoints are also accessible with proper authentication. This is likely an issue with how React Router is handling the /admin route or how the AdminPanel component is being rendered."

        comment: "After researching React Router client-side routing issues, the problem appears to be with server configuration. The server needs to be configured to always return the index.html file for any request that doesn't match a static file. This is a common issue with single-page applications (SPAs) when accessing routes directly. The solution would be to configure the server (likely Nginx or similar) to redirect all non-static file requests to index.html, allowing React Router to handle the routing on the client side. The route is defined correctly in App.js, but the server isn't properly configured to handle direct access to the /admin route."

        comment: "Fixed the admin menu issues by implementing two key fixes: 1) Layout Issue: Created MainLayout component that conditionally renders Header/Footer only for non-admin routes, isolating the admin panel from main site layout. 2) API Connection Issue: Fixed API_BASE_URL configuration in AdminPanel to properly construct the backend URL by appending '/api' to REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL instead of replacing it. The admin login page now displays correctly without main site interference, and the authentication API calls should work properly. User confirmed the admin login page is now visible, resolving the original routing issue."

    message: "Completed testing of Jimmy's Tapas Bar backend API. Most endpoints are working correctly, but there's an issue with CORS configuration. The CORS middleware is configured in server.py but not working correctly for OPTIONS requests. The main issue is that OPTIONS requests are not returning the expected CORS headers."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Fixed the CORS configuration issue by adding an explicit OPTIONS route handler and updating the CORS middleware configuration. All backend API endpoints are now working correctly, including CORS support. The MongoDB connection is also working properly, and all API responses are valid JSON."

    message: "Completed testing of Jimmy's Tapas Bar frontend menu optimizations. All features are working correctly. The Speisekarte page loads with the mediterranean textured background, category filtering works properly, hover images appear on menu items, and the mobile responsive behavior is correct. There are some console errors related to image loading from Unsplash, but these appear to be testing environment restrictions rather than implementation issues."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of all the major improvements made to the Jimmy's Tapas Bar website. The new homepage design with the emotional hero section and Spanish restaurant background works perfectly. The enhanced Speisekarte with two-column layout displays correctly on desktop and stacks properly on mobile. The enhanced hover images are larger (280x280px) with elegant frames and appear with smooth animations. All 15 category filter buttons work correctly with the two-column layout. The overall visual design achieves a warm Spanish atmosphere with proper color harmony. Navigation between pages works smoothly, and all pages maintain the enhanced design elements. All improvements have been successfully implemented and are working as expected."

    message: "Completed comprehensive redesign of Jimmy's Tapas Bar website to match the provided reference image. Updated homepage hero image to elegant Spanish restaurant interior, applied consistent dark brown background across entire website, removed emoji icons from category buttons, added beautiful background image to menu header section, enhanced mouseover effects with proper shadows and larger images (320x240px), and created sophisticated speisekarte-background with dark brown gradients. All changes maintain the elegant Spanish restaurant atmosphere while improving visual consistency and user experience."

    message: "Completed verification testing of Jimmy's Tapas Bar backend API after changes. All endpoints are working correctly. Successfully tested: 1) Root endpoint GET /api/ returns 'Hello World', 2) POST /api/status with Spanish restaurant name 'Reserva Mesa Paella' works correctly, 3) GET /api/status retrieves all created status checks, 4) MongoDB connection is working properly, 5) CORS configuration is correctly implemented with all required headers, and 6) All API responses return valid JSON. No issues were found during testing."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the extended CMS backend for Jimmy's Tapas Bar Admin System. All new endpoints are working correctly except for one minor issue with unauthorized access handling. Successfully tested: 1) Authentication with admin credentials and JWT token validation, 2) Content management for retrieving and updating page content, 3) Menu management for retrieving and creating menu items, 4) Review management for creating and retrieving pending reviews, 5) Contact message handling for sending and retrieving messages, 6) Maintenance mode activation and status checking, and 7) User management for creating and retrieving users. The only issue found is that protected endpoints return 403 Forbidden instead of 401 Unauthorized when accessed without authentication, which is a minor issue as the endpoints are still properly protected."

    message: "Successfully fixed the admin menu issues! Identified and resolved two critical problems: 1) Layout Interference: The AdminPanel was being rendered with the main site Header/Footer components causing display conflicts. Fixed by creating a MainLayout component that conditionally excludes Header/Footer for admin routes. 2) API Connection Error: The AdminPanel had incorrect API URL configuration, using REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL directly instead of appending '/api'. Fixed the API_BASE_URL construction to properly append '/api' to the backend URL. The admin login page now displays correctly in isolation, and authentication should work properly with the backend API."

    message: "Completed testing of the new Newsletter System and Enhanced Menu System for Jimmy's Tapas Bar. Most newsletter endpoints are working correctly, including subscription, unsubscription, subscriber management, templates, and campaigns. However, there are issues with the SMTP configuration endpoint (POST /api/admin/newsletter/smtp) which returns a 500 Internal Server Error. The Enhanced Menu System has mixed results: creating, updating, and deleting menu items work correctly, but retrieving menu items (GET /api/menu/items) returns a 500 Internal Server Error due to a data type mismatch - the price field is expected to be a string but some items have it as a float. This suggests a database migration issue where the data format doesn't match the model definition."
